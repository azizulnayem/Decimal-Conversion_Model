# Decimal-Conversion_Model
In this project, I designed a feature-rich calculator with advanced functionality for converting decimal values to binary, hexadecimal, and octal formats. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface where numeric input can be entered for conversion. The input field comes with a placeholder text that guides users on the expected input format.

To ensure accuracy and user satisfaction, the calculator only accepts numerical input. If any invalid input is detected, the output label at the center of the calculator displays a "Not a Number" (NaN) prompt, alerting users to the issue.

For seamless conversion between different numeral systems, dedicated buttons for binary, hexadecimal, and octal conversions are provided. Users can input decimal values and then select the desired conversion format. Upon clicking these buttons, the output label instantly generates the corresponding values in the chosen numeral system, providing users with immediate results.

To maintain a clutter-free interface, a "Clear" button is integrated, which serves to erase both input and output content from the screen. This action resets the calculator and reverts it to its initial state with the placeholder text displayed.

Adding to the user experience, there's an option to switch to a different screen or scene. Navigating to the new scene reveals a distinct interface, and a dedicated button allows users to easily return to the original calculator screen, ensuring a smooth transition between functionalities.

To maintain a user-centric approach, an "Exit" button is available, enabling users to exit the calculator application effortlessly whenever needed, without any hassle.

In essence, this calculator project offers a comprehensive solution for converting decimal values to binary, hexadecimal, and octal formats. It prioritizes usability by only accepting valid input, providing immediate conversions, and allowing users to navigate between different screens with ease.
